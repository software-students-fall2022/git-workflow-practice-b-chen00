# Programmers and Stack Overflow

## [How often do software engineers use Stack Overflow?](https://developerpitstop.com/how-often-do-software-engineers-use-stack-overflow/#:~:text=98%25%20of%20software%20engineers%20use,a%20whopping%2084%20million%20comments.)

<p>I found this article interesting because Stack Overflow is a resource often encountered and used when I am debugging. Regardless of what my question or problem is, there will always be someone who encountered a similar issue before with an appropriate response or solution to it. It makes sense given the large user-base of Stack Overflow with 98% of engineers using Stack Overflow in some capacity every month. Going beyond my life as a student, it seems that Stack overflow continues to be useful even as a working software engineer. Even though less than 4% of software engineers contribute to the website, Stack Overflow remains to be a big and reliable source of information. To me, it almost feels like cheat when I am using it. On the other hand, the article brings up a good point on how Stack Overflow should be used. Developers will definitely continue to use Stack Overflow but it is important to use it "as a resource and not blindly rely on it."

Even though it is very easy to copy and paste what you need, Stack Overflow provides a good opportunity to learn from others.
