# Programmers and Stack Overflow

## [How often do software engineers use Stack Overflow?](https://developerpitstop.com/how-often-do-software-engineers-use-stack-overflow/#:~:text=98%25%20of%20software%20engineers%20use,a%20whopping%2084%20million%20comments.)

<p>I found this article interesting because Stack Overflow is a resource often encountered and used when I am debugging. Regardless of what my question or problem is, there will always be someone who encountered a similar issue before with an appropriate response or solution to it. It makes sense given the large user-base of Stack Overflow with 98% of engineers using Stack Overflow in some capacity every month. Going beyond my life as a student, it seems that Stack overflow continues to be useful even as a working software engineer. Even though less than 4% of software engineers contribute to the website, Stack Overflow remains to be a big and reliable source of information. To me, it almost feels like cheat when I am using it. On the other hand, the article brings up a good point on how Stack Overflow should be used. Developers will definitely continue to use Stack Overflow but it is important to use it "as a resource and not blindly rely on it."

Even though it is very easy to copy and paste what you need, Stack Overflow provides a good opportunity to learn from others.

## Comment from Tim Chen

This is indeed an interesting article. I think StackOverflow is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it can improve our work efficiency, save our debugging time, and let us learn new things; but on the other hand, we can easily be “addicted” by it - - so that as soon as we have any problems, we go to StackOverflow to search for solutions, which will weaken our ability to think independently about our future issues. So I think we need to use StackOverflow reasonably and moderately; in addition, when we answer questions on StackOverflow, we also need to help the questioner understand What and Why the problem is rather than simply provide a solution.

#### Opinion from Michael Ma

Wow, very interesting topic! I was curious to see what developers in the field think about Stack Overflow. I personally think Stack Overflow is an incredibly useful tool analogous to a calculator. Before teachers allow us to use calculators in math class, we have to master the concepts of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division in earlier math classes. Similarly, as a developer in the field, we should be using tools such as Stack Overflow to help us find the root of certain problems instead of searching through manuals and books. These tools exist for a reason and their alternatives are either outdated or far less efficient. As a student, we should be exercising our ability to use the less efficient version of these tools (ex: only using the manual for a language) while working on our assignments. This ensures that when we do use tools like Stack Overflow, we know how to use it properly and understand it's value.
